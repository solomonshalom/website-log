# Whale Translator

A simple whale translator to translate text from human speech to whale. I'm currently working on the reverse of this translation.
In the future, this will have a command line interface (One day, after I learn javascript fully). 

# Special Thanks

Thanks to codecademy for helping me learn javascript, I highly recommend their courses for all those who want to learn programming.
They offer a wide variety of languages to choose from and even frameworks. Go check them out!

# Contributions 

Makes as much as contributions as you can, together we can take a simple program to a whole new height. All PR's will be merged, thanks!
